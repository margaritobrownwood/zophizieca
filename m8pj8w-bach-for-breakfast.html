Last weekend he and I were supposed to be flying out for a business trip. The day before we left I got a call from my boss saying I needed to get my drawings out immediately for our asshole client. I begrudgingly agreed to have it done in two days and told my husband I would have to stay home. Henryk Szeryng: Польский и мексиканский скрипач еврейского происхождения. J.S.
